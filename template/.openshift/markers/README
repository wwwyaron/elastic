Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

es_heap_size_percent - Sets how much percent of the gear memory should be assigned to ElasticSearch.
    This number is used to calculate how much memory will be exposed to ES via env var ES_HEAP_SIZE.
    Default value is 90.
