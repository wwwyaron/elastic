## ElasticSearch plugins to install, one per line.
## Edit this file, commit and push. All plugins will be
## installed inside all gears.
##
## To use a specific URL to download plugin code from, use:
##   [PLUGIN_NAME]=[URL]
## Ex:
##   myplugin=https://mysite.com/elasticsearch/my-awesome-plugin.zip
##
## To install a plugin from a zip file, simply place the file inside dir
## plugins/ and git add+commit it. No need to do place configs here.

## Configuration is build on-the-fly with initial contents from file

## same dir (except for logging.yml and elasticsearch.in.sh). Files ending with
## .erb will be pre-processed using ruby's erb command.
